- Hi, my name is Chimeziri Obioha. I'm a Python backend programmer with experience working independently and part-time since 2020. I'm now looking to collaborate in a great team moving forward.

- My major self-developed and self-supervised projects include [Tradepally.com](https://Tradepally.com), [Treasurebill.com](https://Treasurebill.com), and [Safenatty.com](https://Safenatty.com), all of which I founded.

- I'm currently learning Cybersecurity through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course on Coursera, while also gaining professional experience at HNG11 Internship, (https://hng.tech).

- I resume daily at my agency banking business outlet in Lagos, Nigeria, powered by [Tradepally](https://Tradepally.com).

- I call myself the #tradersTechie because I'm a spare parts trader turned techie.

- You can reach me via traderstechie@gmail.com or [@tradersTechie on X](https://x.com/tradersTechie).

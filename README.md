- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Chimeziri Obioha. I'm a Python backend programmer with experience working independently and part-time since 2020. I've also collaborated remotely with other tech talents to build [Tifi.tv](https://tifi.tv) for HNG Tech. I'm looking for a great team to join full-time moving forward.

- ðŸ‘€ My major self-developed and self-supervised projects include [Tradepally.com](https://Tradepally.com), [Treasurebill.com](https://Treasurebill.com), and [Safenatty.com](https://Safenatty.com), all of which I founded.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Cybersecurity through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course on Coursera.

- âš¡ I currently work daily at my agency banking business outlet in Lagos, Nigeria, powered by [Tradepally](https://Tradepally.com).

- ðŸ˜„ I call myself the #tradersTechie because I'm a spare parts trader turned techie.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me via traderstechie@gmail.com or [@tradersTechie on X](https://x.com/tradersTechie).
